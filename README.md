## Quick Start
### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- Vulkan SDK 1.3+ and glslc compiler (included in the official SDK)
  - On Linux, install the Vulkan SDK via your package manager or download it from the [LunarG website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
  - On Windows, download the Vulkan SDK from the [LunarG website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) and set the environment variables as instructed.
  - Alternatively, you can install vulkan packages via your package manager. Make sure to install the `vulkan-devel` package (or equivalent) and the `glslang` package (can be included in `shaderc` or `glslang` packages).
- CMake 3.25+
- Git with submodules support

### Building

Linux :
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Darkbriks/liara-engine.git
cd liara-engine

# Configure and build
cmake --preset=linux-release # You can also use linux-debug for debug build
cmake --build --preset=linux-release

# Run demo
cd build/linux-release/app/ # It's important to run the demo from the app directory to ensure correct resource paths
./Demo
```

Windows :
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Darkbriks/liara-engine.git
cd liara-engine

# Configure and build
cmake --preset=windows-release # You can also use windows-debug for debug build
cmake --build --preset=windows-release

# Run demo
cd build/windows-release/app/Release/ # It's important to run the demo from the app directory to ensure correct resource paths
Demo.exe
```

These commands will compile the engine and run the demo application. The demo showcases some capabilities of the engine.
The demo loads a viking room model, with dynamic lighting, ImGui interface, and basic camera controls.
You can navigate the scene using WASD keys. You can also modify fullscreen mode with F11, and VSync with F10.

## Configuration

The engine uses a flexible settings system supporting runtime modifications:
```c++
// Trivial type settings
settings.SetBool("graphics.vsync", true);
settings.SetUInt("texture.max_anisotropy", 16);

// Complex types with custom serialization
settings.RegisterType<glm::vec3>("graphics.ambient_light", glm::vec3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f));
settings.Set<glm::vec3>("graphics.ambient_light", glm::vec3(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f));

// Accessing settings
bool vsync = settings.GetBool("graphics.vsync");
glm::vec3 ambientLight = settings.Get<glm::vec3>("graphics.ambient_light");
```
Settings are automatically saved to `settings.cfg` on exit and loaded on startup, allowing persistent configuration across sessions. In the future, I plan to add a GUI for settings management using ImGui.
